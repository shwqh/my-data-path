# Excel Formulas ðŸ§®

These are five basic statistical functions in Excel that Iâ€™m learning and using:

---

## 1. MAX  
Returns the largest number in a range of values.  
```excel
=MAX(A1:A10)
```

---

## 2. MIN  
Returns the smallest number in a range of values.  
```excel
=MIN(A1:A10)
```

---

## 3. SUM  
Adds all the numbers in a range of cells.  
```excel
=SUM(A1:A10)
```

---

## 4. AVERAGE  
Calculates the average (arithmetic mean) of numbers.  
```excel
=AVERAGE(A1:A10)
```

---

## 5. MEDIAN  
Returns the middle number in a sorted list of numbers.  
```excel
=MEDIAN(A1:A10)
```
