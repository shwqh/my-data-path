# ✅ VLOOKUP & HLOOKUP Functions Mastery

---

## 🔥 What I Learned
In this lesson, I explored two essential Excel functions that help in retrieving specific data efficiently:
- **VLOOKUP**: Allows you to search vertically in a table and return a related value from a specific column.
- **HLOOKUP**: Lets you search horizontally across the top row and return a related value from a specific row.

## ✨ How I Practiced
- Applied **VLOOKUP** on a startup funding dataset to find corresponding funding amounts based on company names.
- Used **HLOOKUP** on a monthly personal expenditure sheet to fetch specific category expenses across different months.
- Practiced writing formulas manually and dragging them efficiently using the Fill Handle.
- Enhanced the outputs by formatting results into currency format for better presentation.
