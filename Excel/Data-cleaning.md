## 🧼 Cleaning Data (Excel)

In this lab, I learned how to clean and organize messy data using practical tools and functions in Excel. Here’s a quick summary of what I did:

---

### ✏️ Fixing Spelling Errors
- Used the **Spell Check** tool to correct spelling mistakes.
- Skipped the word `jcb` as instructed.

### 🗑️ Removing Empty & Duplicate Rows
- Filtered and deleted blank rows.
- Highlighted duplicates with **Conditional Formatting**.
- Removed duplicates using the **Remove Duplicates** feature.

### 🔠 Adjusting Text Case
Applied Excel functions to fix inconsistent text casing:
- `PROPER` – to capitalize the first letter of each word.
- `UPPER` – to make text uppercase.
- `LOWER` – to make text lowercase.

### 📅 Date Formatting
- Changed the date format via **More Number Formats** to use a consistent style (U.S. format).

### ✂️ Trimming Extra Spaces
- Used **Find & Replace** to remove extra spaces and keep text clean.

### ⚡ Flash Fill & Functions
- Used **Flash Fill** to quickly reformat or extract data from full names.
- Also used functions like:
  - `LEFT`
  - `RIGHT`
  - `LEN`
  - `SEARCH`
